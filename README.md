my first repository

Hello!

I have zero coding experience and very little experience with computers in gerneral.

I am a baker by trade so when I stumbled upon raspberry pi I figured it was time to jump in and play around  =)

Well Still no clue what I am doing. Lost focus, stepped away, now on a wild hair again.
